Challenge: Addition of Coordinates
Medium
Problem Description
Create a program to find the sum of two coordinates by creating objects.

Create a class

Create a class named Coordinate with attributes x and y.
Use the __init__() method with two arguments to initialize these attributes.
The class must also have a method named add_coordinates() that adds x and y attributes of two objects, then creates a new Coordinate object with these values, and returns the new Coordinate object.
Outside the class

Create two coordinates (objects of the Coordinate class) named c1 and c2.
The x and y attributes of c1 should be 5 and 6 respectively.
The x and y attributes of c2 should be 7 and 9 respectively.
Call add_coordinates() using the c1 object with c2 as an argument, and store the result to the c3 variable.
Print the x attribute of c3.
Print the y attribute of c3.
For hints, see the code outline.
